# Utility-Optical-Recognition
This tool is an add-on to Oak Ridge National Lab's tool Verifi. It's purpose is to help automate obtaining utility bill data. This component uses optical character recognition (OCR) through Tesseract.JS to extract bill attributes.

## About Verifi
The Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office has tasked Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop a tool to track, visualize, analyze and even forecast facility utility data in industrial settings. This tool will incorporate and expand on several existing DOE tools (EnPI, EnPI Lite, Energy Footprint Tool, Plant Energy Profiler), most of which currently are excel-based or excel-add ons. This project will integrate them into a common, open-source framework which is harmonized with other DOE software tools – mainly the DOE’s <a href="https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Desktop">MEASUR tool suite</a>.
